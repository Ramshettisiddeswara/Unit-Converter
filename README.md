# Unit-Converter

🌟 Project Overview

The Unit Converter is a powerful tool that allows users to convert between different units, such as length, weight, and temperature. With a user-friendly interface and precise functionality, it’s a perfect assistant for quick and accurate conversions.

💻 Technologies Used

Front-End: Java Swing for crafting the GUI
Back-End: Java for implementing conversion logic

🛠️ Key Features

Multi-Category Conversions: Supports conversions for length (e.g., meters to kilometers), weight (e.g., grams to kilograms), and temperature (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).
Interactive Design: Easy-to-use dropdown menus for selecting units and input fields for entering values.
Accuracy: Ensures precise calculations for all supported conversions.
Lightweight and Fast: Quickly performs conversions without delays.

📈 Learning Outcomes

This project honed my skills in handling user input, creating responsive GUIs, and implementing precise calculation logic. It was a valuable opportunity to solve real-world problems through programming.
